          Supply chain operations and network extend beyond domestic boundaries and global 
          boundaries of all countries. A logistical exercise originates at the buyers end 
          and involves multiple agencies including buyer, seller, 3PL freight forwarder, 
          transporters at various juncture, shipping lines, airlines, various governmental 
          agencies, customs departments at various locations and financial institutions like 
          banks to complete the entire supply chain cycle.
        </p>      
        <p>
          Smooth flowing of materials in a journey originating at one point and going through 
          the entire cycle of exports and imports to reach a point of consumption would mean 
          engagement and interaction with all of the above agencies who have a stake in the said 
          transaction. Need for decision making concerning financial, commercial, technical, 
          operational matters about shipments arise at various times in the cycle, which demands 
          that the 3PL, the logistics carrier, the buyer, the supplier are actively engaged and 
          have visibility to information and documentation for the smooth flow across various 
          transit points. In fact, in faultless logistics operations, the documentation and 
          information flow should precede physical movement of goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Documentation becomes important not only for the physical logistics operations 
          involving multiple agencies engaged in the entire chain, the financial, trading and 
          accounting processes of the both buyer and seller organizations and partner banks also 
          involved depend upon the entire set of documentation pertaining to each transaction to 
          be able to recognize the sale, recognize value of consignment and effect necessary 
          payment.

        being the Internet and IT technology that helps manage information and data ahead 
        of or along with flow of materials and goods.

        Procurement Logistics, Manufacturing Logistics and Finished Goods Logistics 
        functions are managed by different independent departments in a company. Though the 
        duties of the departments involve common activities like transportation etc., however, 
        the processes and nature of logistics functions are specific to each function besides 
        the requirements and sensitivities of delivery times, schedules, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the emerging trends and availability of third party logistics providers has pushed 
        the companies to adapt the practice of outsourcing all supply chain components and 
        logistics functions termed as noncore functions to their logistics providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this topic we shall examine the role and functions of Third Party Service Providers a 
        little closely to understand how they make a difference to the supply chain activities.

          Maritime trade has existed since times immemorial. History is replete with the 
          major maritime routes that connected continents across the globe and enabled 
          trade between them. <code>Harbors and waterways have flourished in strategic locations</code> 
          in all countries attracting trade and commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Global trade is <code>dependant 80% on sea route than air route,</code>  simply for the 
          fact that air route is far more expensive and is used only in case of light weight cargo, 
          perishable cargo, and priority shipments or in other conditions where shipping would not be possible.
